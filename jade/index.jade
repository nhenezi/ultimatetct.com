          h2.align-left How do I win on minor boards?
          p
            | Rules on minor boards are similar to standard Tic-Tac-Toe with one twist:
            | When you play on a minor board, your opponent is forced to play on that major board.
            | Take a look at the picture on left, you have placed O in top-right corner.
            | So your oponnent is forced to play on top-right major board.

          p
            | Then you oponnent has no restrictions on next move; i.e. he can play anywhere!
